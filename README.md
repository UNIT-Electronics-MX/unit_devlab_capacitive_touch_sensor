# Touch Capacitive Sensor

## Introduction

<!-- FILL HERE -->
The UNIT Touch Capacitive Sensor transforms a simple touch into a precise digital signal—no buttons, no moving parts. Powered by the TTP223B capacitive sensing chip, this board continuously monitors its flat electrode pad and instantly reports “touch detected” via a clean HIGH logic output. Whether you’re building a sleek control panel, a wearable interface, or a touch-activated lamp, this sensor delivers reliable, debounce-free touch detection with minimal wiring and virtually zero power draw at rest.
